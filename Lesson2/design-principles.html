            <h2>Contrast</h2>
            <img src="images/spacecenter2.png" alt="contrast example">
            <h4 class="website"><a href="https://spacecenter.alpineschools.org/">Christa McAuliffe Space Center</a></h4>
            <p>This is an example of using contrast simply because of the 
                light and dark elements that are used here. The background of this website
                is generally dark gray or black. However, the text and some of the highlighted
                elements are very bright. The title of the website is in a white font which
                is in contrast with the dark background. What this does is it highlights 
                certain elements of the website that the user should look at.

            <h2>Proximity</h2>
            <img src="images/youtube2.png" alt="proximity example">
            <h4 class="website"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube.com</a></h4>
            <p>This one is a great example of using Proximity as a design principle. What makes it
                good is what it does to keep similar features together. On the bottom, you can see all 
                of the features and options that a user can select to improve their experience. At
                the top you see search options as well as key information about the user account 
                and the website itself. In the main section of the website you have the content of
                the site all in one place. This keeps the site organized but also allows for a 
                clean user experience.
             </p>

            <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
            <img src="images/google2.png" alt="white space example">
            <h4 class="website"><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google.com</a></h4>
            <p>
                Now for white space, the example here is google. White space is a tricky thing
                and too much or too little can be detrimental. However, google is a good example here
                because it really is a minimalistic approach to content. You can see that for most 
                of the page, it is empty. Except for the main logo, there are few colors on the 
                screen. What this does is it draws the user in to the middle of the screen where 
                the purpose of the site can be achieved. It minimizes distraction and keeps the user
                focused on what they are doing.
