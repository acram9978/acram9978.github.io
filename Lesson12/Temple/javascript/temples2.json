On June 9, 2013, it was formally dedicated by Bishop Gary E. Stevenson. The visitors' center is located next to the temple in a building that originally housed Distribution Services. When Distribution Services was relocated by a Deseret Book, a short distance away, it was decided that the building would be converted to a visitors' center.",
